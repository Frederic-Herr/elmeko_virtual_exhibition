# ELMEKO Virtual Exhibition

Since it was difficult or even impossible to visit trade fairs in times of the corona virus, I developed a virtual trade fair stand for the [website of the ELMEKO GmbH & Co. KG company](https://www.elmeko.de/en/home).

    Key aspects:

        - Made with Unity-Engine
        - Almost all content can be exchanged on the server. (Texts, video, images)
        - Shows current products and links to various pages of the ELMEKO website

Transition to the [cooling unit PK 150](#cooling-unit-pk-150).

## Cooling unit PK 150

The cooling unit can be rotated with the mouse or finger. On the right-hand side is the most important information and a button that links to the product in the online shop.

## Out-Fit

This object can also be rotated and the ‘Details’ button leads to a detailed product presentation, which can also be called up separately on the website of ELMEKO.
This presentation was also developey by me with the Unity-Engine.

DeltaT is software for determining the right cooling unit or heater for the enclosure.
A click on the laptop leads to this programme.

## Light Selection

The Light Selector was another tool on the ELMEKO website to find suitable lights for the control cabinet.
However, this tool is no longer available.
